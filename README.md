# Project-1
Gone Fishin'

user 1 enters their name

user 2 enters their name

either player presses the begin game button to put fish in the pond

player 1 clicks their rod to cast a line and a fish is caught

player 1 attemots to stop the ball as close to center as possible to get the biggest catch

player 2 repeats the same process

after 5 attempts each to catch a fish the game is over and whichever user caught more weight in fish will be declared the winner the othere user will be declared the loser 

realistic goals

both players can cast their line and catch a fish each turn ending in a winner and loser based on the weight of their catch

make it harder for the player who is winning to catch a big fish by speeding up the ball in the canvas section

stretch goal

if one player is winning by too much there is a chance their catch is stolen by an ocean predator
