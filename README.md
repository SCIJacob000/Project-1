# Project-1
Battling Dragons
(based on a snake game idea)

Player1 will enter their name in the correct box and selects a color to name their dragon

player 2 will enter their name in the correct box and selects a color to name their dragon

either user will preses the new game button

users will use keys to determine direction dragon goes

when the round ends the user will press next round which will refresh the canvas to represent a new game

first user to win 5 rounds wins the game


realistic goal

make the snakes move faster as the rounds go up (round 1 will be easy and if the game makes it to round 10 the players will barely be able to keep up)




stretch goals
make a breathe fire option on a button press to trigger a certain amount of area infront of the dragon to clear as a last ditch effort to stay alive

include a golden dragon that moves on its own and can "slay" your dragon golden, dragon is immune to breathe fire option!
golden dragon possibly spirals from center out
