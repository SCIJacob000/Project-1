# Project-1
Euchre

either user presses star game button and cards are dealt

user 1 is offered to order up the flip card to declare the trump suit and or "go alone"

if no then the computer is offered if not then user 2 is offered to order up the flip card to declare the trump suit and or "go alone" if not computer 2 is offered the same

if one of the users is the dealer for that round they will be prompted to "trash" a card to be replaced with the card that was ordered up

if no-one chooses the card the process repeats by offering each user and computer the option to call a trump suit as long as 

it doesnt match the card they passed on originally

once the trump suit has been decided player 1 will play their first card followed by the computer followed by player two 

followed by comp 2

the users and comps will repeat this until the round is over (all cards have been played)

at which point the users will be made aware the round is over who won and how as well as see the points display change 

a deal cards buttons will appear that the user will press to shuffle and redeal the cards for the next round

when a team reaches 10 points the user will be alerted of who won and the final score of the game!
